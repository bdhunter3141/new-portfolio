        <p>Hello! I'm Bryan, and I create websites.</p>
        <p>I am also the Web Developer & Data Coordinator at <a href="https://www.nacocanada.com/cpages/home" class="outbound-link" target="_blank">NACO (National Angel Capital Organization)</a>.  I create all of NACO's web applications, manage and analyze national data on investment, and co-author the <a href="https://www.nacocanada.com/cpages/angel-activity-report" class="outbound-link" target="_blank">Annual Report on Canadian Angel Investing Activity</a>.</p>
        <p>I enjoy building applications from scratch and seeing how my work can make a positive impact on the lives of others. I work on the front end, the back end... all of the ends!</p>
        <p>My code is DRY and modular and I am always pushing myself to improve. One of my favourite parts of working in web development is having the opportunity to continually learn new technologies and find fresh ways to tackle a problem.</p>
        <p>I used to work as an Air Traffic Controller and Flight Service Specialist. I've learned to work very well under pressure.</p>
